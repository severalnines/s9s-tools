Key-pair based authentication

NOTE: this authentication method is experimental, but in long term
will replace the current RPC token based one

* S9s CLI authentication related options and behavior

Important: for now if you specify -t, --rpc-token=TOKEN then
token will be used instead of key based auhentication.

** Steps needs to be done for key-pair based authentication

  1) Generate a key for a user (it is advised to use the same username which is
  used on Frontend, so later on you can manage your pubkeys there like in
  github)

  $ s9s user --cmon-user=myfancyuser@domain.tld --generate-key

  The generated 2048 RSAbit key-pair will be saved to ~/.s9s/USERNAME.[pub|key].
  NOTE this command will save the username into ~/.s9s/s9s.conf ([global],
  cmon_user) for later use.

  2) Grant/create the user on controller and upload the public key.

  For this step you must have SSH access (and sudo/superuser privileges) to the
  controller node (where cmon daemon runs.)

  $ s9s user --verbose --create --controller=https://CONTROLLER_ADDR:9500

  NOTE: these two steps (1) and 2)) can be done in one command like:

  $ s9s user --cmon-user=myfancyuser@domain.tld --generate-key \
        --create --controller=https://CONTROLLER_ADDR:9500

  Alternatively)

  If this is not possible (SSH .. etc), you should copy the pubkey into a
  pendrive, bring it to controller plugin, then gain superuser access there
  and grant/create your RPC user manually, for now it will goes like:

  echo "{\"username\":\"kedazo@severalnines.com\", \"pubkey\": \"$(cat ./user.pubkey)\"}" \
  > /var/lib/cmon/usermgmt.fifo

** Other method to generate an RSA key and configure the s9s client:
  
  You can use the OpenSSL command line to generate an RSA keypair
  # generating the private key
  # (keep this in secure place, do not transfer over network)
  $ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out user.privkey -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
  # then extract its public key part into a separate file (can be shared.. etc)
  $ openssl rsa -pubout -in user.privkey -out user.pubkey

  Then add your username and the path to the key in ~/.s9s/s9s.conf into
  [global] section:
  cmon_user=cmonusername@domain.tld
  auth_key=~/my/path/to/private.key

  Then you should also grant this key on controller which is desribed above.

** After user granted

 After this grant has created and your ~/.s9s/s9s.conf has the auth_user,
 then user will be authenticated to controller before every RPC call.
