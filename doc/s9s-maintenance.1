.SH NAME
s9s-maintenance \- Command line client for the Severalnines Clustercontrol server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B s9s-maintenance
.RI [OPTION]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBs9s\fP  is a command line tool for ClusterControl, which can be used to
deploy and operate MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Main Option"
The application should always be started using a main option that sets what
operation should be performed. This "main option" should be one of the
following:

.TP
.B \-L, \-\-list
List the registered maintenance periods from the ClusterControl controller. 

.TP
.B \-\-create
Ccreate a new maintenance period.

.SS Generic Options

.TP
.B \-\-help
Print the help message and exist.

.TP
.B \-\-debug
Print even the debug level messages.

.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Print more messages than normally.

.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version information and exit.

.TP
.BR \-c " [\fIPROT\fP://]\fIHOSTNAME\fP[:\fIPORT\fP]" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-controller=" [\fIPROT\fP://]\\fIHOSTNAME\fP[:\fIPORT\fP]
The host name of the Cmon Controller. The protocol and port is also accepted as
part of the hostname (e.g. --controller="https://127.0.0.1:9556").

.TP
.BI \-P " PORT" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-controller-port=" PORT
The port where the Cmon Controller is waiting for connections.

.TP
.BI \-u " USERNAME" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-cmon\-user=" USERNAME
Sets the name of the Cmon user (the name of the account maintained by the Cmon
Controller) to be used to authenticate. Since most of the functionality needs
authentication this command line option should be very frequently used or set in
the configuration file. Please check the documentation of the s9s.conf(5) to see
how the Cmon User can be set using the \fBcmon_user\fP configuration variable.

.TP
.BI \-p " PASSWORD" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-password=" PASSWORD
The password for the Cmon User (whose user name is set using the 
\fB\-\^\-cmon\-user\fP command line option or using the \fBcmon_user\fP
configuration value). Providing the password is not mandatory, the user
authentication can also be done using a private/public keypair automatically.

.TP
.BI \-\^\-private\-key\-file= FILE
The path to the private key file that will be used for the authentication.

.TP
.B \-l, \-\-long
This option is similar to the -l option for the standard ls UNIX utility
program. If the program creates a list of objects this option will change its
format to show more details.

.TP
.B \-\-print-json
The JSON strings will be printed while communicating with the controller. This 
option is for debugging purposes.

.TP
.BR \-\^\-color [ =\fIWHEN\fP "]
Turn on and off the syntax highlighting of the output. The supported values for 
.I WHEN
is
.BR never ", " always ", or " auto .

.TP
.B \-\-batch
Print no messages. If the application created a job print only the job ID number
and exit. If the command prints data do not use syntax highlight, headers,
totals, only the pure table to be processed using filters.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-header
Do not print headers for tables.

.TP
.BR \-\^\-date\-format =\fIFORMATSTRING\fP "]
Set the date and time format for the output of the program. The format string 
is as it is specified for the strftime() standard C library function. 

.TP
.B \-\-full-uuid
Print the full UUID string in the output, do not abbreviate it.

.TP
.BI \-\^\-end= DATETIME
A string representation of the date and time when the maintenance period will

ST UUID    OWNER  GROUP  START    END      HOST/CLUSTER  REASON
Ah a7e037a system admins 11:21:24 11:41:24 192.168.1.113 Rolling restart. 
Total: 1

.fi

The list contains the following fields:
.RS 5
.TP
.B ST 
The short status information, where at the first character position 'A' stands 
for 'active' and '-' stands for 'inactive'. At the second character position 'h'
stands for 'host related maintenance' and 'c' stands for 'cluster related
maintenence'.
.TP

first few characters of the UUID is shown, but if the \-\-full\-uuid command
line option is provided the full length string will be printed.

.\" The examples. The are very helpful for people just started to use the
.\" application.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Here is an example that shows how to create a new maintenance period for a given
host.

.nf
# \fBs9s maintenance \\
    --create \\
    --nodes=192.168.1.121 \\
    --start="$(date -d 'now + 1 day' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" \\
    --end="$(date -d 'now + 1 day + 1 hour' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" \\
    --reason="Upgrading software."\fR
.fi

The next line will show all the maintenance periods printing only the date (and
not the date and time) for the start and end of the periods.

.nf
# \fBs9s maintenance \\
    --list \\
    --long \\
    --date-format="%F"\fR
.fi

Deleting the maintenance period by providing the first few characters of the
maintenance period.

.nf
# \fBs9s maintenance \\
    --delete \\
    --uuid=77262b6\fR
.fi
