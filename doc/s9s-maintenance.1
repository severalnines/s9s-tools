.SH NAME
s9s-maintenance \- Command line client for the Severalnines Clustercontrol server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B s9s-maintenance
.RI [OPTION]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBs9s\fP  is a command line tool for ClusterControl, which can be used to
deploy and operate MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Main Option"
The application should always be started using a main option that sets what
operation should be performed. This "main option" should be one of the
following:

\"
\"
\"
.TP
.B --create
Create a new maintenance period.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s maintenance \\
    --create \\
    --nodes="192.168.0.244" \\
    --start="2019-10-30T13:48:07.000Z" \\
    --end="2019-10-30T13:48:17.000Z" \\
    --reason="Memory upgrade." 
.fi

.TP
.B --current
Prints the active maintenance for a cluster or for a host. Prints nothing if no
maintenance period is active.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s maintenance --current --cluster-id=1
.fi

.TP
.B --delete
Delete an existing maintenance period. The maintenance periods are identified by
their UUID strings. The UUID stings by default shown in an abbreviated format.
When the \fB\-\-full\-uuid\fP command line option is provided the full length
UUID strings will be shown.

Deleting a maintenance period is also possible by providing only the first few
characters of the UUID when these first characters are unique and enough to
identify the maintenance period.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s maintenance \\
    --delete \\
    --uuid="6b55b1c5-74cb-4c74-ae3d-c41583005b95" \\
    --batch
.fi

.TP
.B -L, --list
List the registered maintenance periods from the ClusterControl controller. 

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s maintenance --list --long
.fi

.TP
.B --next
Prints information about the very next maintenance period for a cluster or for a
host. Prints nothing if no maintenance is registered to be started in the
future.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s maintenance \\
    --next \\
    --cluster-id="1" \\
    --nodes="192.168.0.227" 
.fi

.SS Generic Options

.TP
.B \-\-help
Print the help message and exist.

.TP
.B \-\-debug
Print even the debug level messages.

.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Print more messages than normally.

.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version

.TP
.BR \-c " [\fIPROT\fP://]\fIHOSTNAME\fP[:\fIPORT\fP]" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-controller=" [\fIPROT\fP://]\\fIHOSTNAME\fP[:\fIPORT\fP]
The host name of the Cmon Controller. The protocol and port is also accepted as
part of the hostname (e.g. --controller="https://127.0.0.1:9556").


.TP
.BI \-u " USERNAME" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-cmon\-user=" USERNAME
Sets the name of the Cmon user (the name of the account maintained by the Cmon
Controller) to be used to authenticate. Since most of the functionality needs
authentication this command line option should be very frequently used or set in
the configuration file. Please check the documentation of the s9s.conf(5) to see
how the Cmon User can be set using the \fBcmon_user\fP configuration variable.

.TP
.BI \-p " PASSWORD" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-password=" PASSWORD
The password for the Cmon User (whose user name is set using the 
\fB\-\^\-cmon\-user\fP command line option or using the \fBcmon_user\fP
configuration value). Providing the password is not mandatory, the user
authentication can also be done using a private/public keypair automatically.

.TP
.BI \-\^\-private\-key\-file= FILE
The path to the private key file that will be used for the authentication. The
default value for the private key is \fB~/.s9s/username.key\fP.

.TP
.B \-l, \-\-long
This option is similar to the -l option for the standard ls UNIX utility
program. If the program creates a list of objects this option will change its
format to show more details.

.TP
.B --print-json
The JSON strings will be printed while communicating with the controller. This 
option is for debugging purposes.

.TP
.BR \-\^\-color [ =\fIWHEN\fP "]
Turn on and off the syntax highlighting of the output. The supported values for 
.I WHEN
is
.BR never ", " always ", or " auto .

.TP
.B --batch
Print no messages. If the application created a job print only the job ID number
and exit. If the command prints data do not use syntax highlight, headers,
totals, only the pure table to be processed using filters.

.TP
.B --no-header
Do not print headers for tables.

.TP
.BR --date-format =\fIFORMATSTRING\fP "]
Set the date and time format for the output of the program. The format string 
is as it is specified for the strftime() standard C library function.
