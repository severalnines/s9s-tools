.TH S9S-BACKUP 1 "December 12, 2017"

.SH NAME
s9s-backup \- Command line client for the Severalnines Clustercontrol server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B s9s-backup
.RI [OPTION]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBs9s\fP  is a command line tool for ClusterControl, which can be used to
deploy and operate MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

.SH OPTIONS

.\"
.\" Main Option
.\"
.SS "Main Option"
The application should always be started using a main option that sets what
operation should be performed. This "main option" should be one of the
following:

.TP
.B --create
Creates a new backup. This command line option will initiate a new job that will
create a new backup.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s backup \\
    --create \\
    --cluster-id=1 \\
    --nodes=192.168.0.209 \\
    --backup-dir=/tmp \\
    --wait
.fi

.TP
.B --create-schedule
This command line option will create a backup schedule, a backup that is
repeated. Please note that there are two ways to create a repeated backup. A job
that creates a backup can be scheduled and repeated and with this option a
backup schedule can be created to repeat the creation of a backup.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s backup \\
    --create-schedule \\
    --cluster-id=1 \\
    --recurrence="0 12 * * 5"
.fi


.TP
.B \-\^\-delete
Delete an existing backup.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s backup \\
    --delete \\
    --backup-id=1
.fi

.TP
.B \-\^\-delete\-old
Delete old backups (AKA backup-retention). This command line option will
initiate a job that checks for expired backups and removes them from the system.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s backup \\
    --delete-old \\
    --cluster-id=1 \\
    --backup-retention=7 \\
    --safety-copies=3 \\
    --log
.fi

.TP
.B \-\^\-delete\-all
Delete all backups (filtering by some property as snapshot repository name). This command 
line option will initiate a job that checks for all backups and 
removes them from the system. db_cluster_id property is used as it could be
that no cluster exists but there is data on db. With forced option it will delete backup
record on db even when backup deletion failed.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s backup \\
    --delete-all \\
    --db-cluster-id=1 \\
    --snapshot-repository=my_s3_repo \\
    --forced
    --log
.fi

.TP
.B \-\^\-list\-databases
List the backups in database view format. This format is designed to show the
archived databases in the backups.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s backup \\
    --list-databases \\
    --long \\
    -h
.fi

.TP
.B \-\^\-list\-files
List the backups in file view format. This format is designed to show the
archive files of the backups.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s backup \\
    --list-files \\
    --long 
.fi

.TP
.B \-L, \-\^\-list
List the backups known for the controller.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
s9s backup \\
    --list \\
    --long
.fi

When listing the backups with the \fB\-\^\-long\fP option the following columns
are listed:

.\"
.\" The list of columns the s9s backup --list --long command will produce.
.\"
.RS 7
.TP
.B ID
The numerical ID of the backup.

.TP 
.B PI
The numerical ID of the parent backup if there is a parent backup for the given
entry.

.TP
.B CID
The numerical ID of the cluster to which the backup belongs.

.TP
.B V
The verification status. Here 'V' means the backup is verified, '-' means the
backup is not verified.

.TP
.B I 
The flag showing if the backup is incremental or not. Here 'F' means the backup
is a full backup, 'I' means the backup is incremental, '-' means the backup
contains no incremental or full backup files (because for example the backup
failed) and 'B' means the backup contains both full and incremental backups
files (which is impossible).

.TP
.B STATE
The state of the backup. Here "COMPLETED" means the backup is completed,
"FAILED" means the backup has failed and "RUNNING" means the backup is being
created.

.TP
.B OWNER
The name of the Cmon user that owns the backup.

.TP
.B HOSTNAME 
The name of the host where the backup was created.

.TP
.B CREATED
The date and time whosing when the backup was created.

.TP
.B SIZE
The total size of the created backup files.

.TP
.B TITLE
The name or title of the backup. This is a human readable string that helps
identify the backup.

Sets the name of the Cmon user (the name of the account maintained by the Cmon
Controller) to be used to authenticate. Since most of the functionality needs
authentication this command line option should be very frequently used or set in
the configuration file. Please check the documentation of the s9s.conf(5) to see
how the Cmon User can be set using the \fBcmon_user\fP configuration variable.

.TP
.BI \-p " PASSWORD" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-password=" PASSWORD
The password for the Cmon User (whose user name is set using the 
\fB\-\^\-cmon\-user\fP command line option or using the \fBcmon_user\fP
configuration value). Providing the password is not mandatory, the user
authentication can also be done using a private/public keypair automatically.

.TP

default value for the private key is \fB~/.s9s/username.key\fP.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-human\-readable
Print the sizes of files in human readable format.

.SS Cluster Related Options

.TP
.BI \-i " INTEGER" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-cluster-id=" INTEGER
If the operation related to an existing cluster this option can be used to
control which cluster will be manipulated. If the operation creates a new
cluster the cluster ID is assigned automatically, so this option can't be used.

.TP
.BI \-n " NAME" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-cluster-name=" NAME
Sets the cluster name. If the operation creates a new cluster this will be the
name of the new cluster. (Usage of this option for selecting an existing cluster
is not yet implemented.)

.TP
.BI \-\^\-nodes= NODELIST

field separator (e.g. "192.168.1.1;192.168.1.2"). 
The strings in the node list are urls that can have the following protocols:

.SS Backup Related Options

.TP
.BI \-\^\-backup\-directory= DIR
Sets where the created archive files are going to be placed.

.TP
.BI \-\^\-temp\-dir\-path= DIR
By default, s9s backup creates temporary backup files to /var/tmp/cmon-% path. Specify
this option with your desired path if you want to target to another location.

.TP
.BI \-\^\-keep\-temp\-dir
Specify this option if you want to retain your archive files from the temporary
directory.

.\"
.\" The backup format string.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\^\-backup\-format [ =\fIFORMATSTRING\fP "]
The string that controls the format of the printed information about the
backups.  When this command line option is used the specified information will
be printed instead of the default columns. The format string uses the '%'
character to mark variable fields and flag characters as they are specified in
the standard printf() C library functions. The '%' specifiers are ended by field
name letters to refer to various properties of the backups.

The "%+12I" format string for example has the "+12" flag characters in it with
the standard meaning: the field will be 12 character wide and the "+" or "-"
sign will always be printed with the number. 

The properties of the backup are encoded by letters. The in the "%16H" for
example the letter "H" encodes the "host name". 

Standard '\\' notation is also available, \\n for example encodes a new-line 
character.

The s9s-tools support the following fields:

print the dates and times can be set using the \fB\-\-date\-format\fP

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP

Here is an example showing how to create a new backup.

.nf
# \fBs9s backup \\
    --create \\
    --nodes=192.168.1.199 \\
    --cluster-id=1 \\
    --wait\fR
.fi

Another example simply lists the backups:

.nf
# \fBs9s backup \\
    --list \\
    --cluster-id=1 \\
    --long -h\fR
.fi

The next example will create a job to verify the given backup identified by the
backup ID. The job will attempt to install MySql on the test server using the
same settings as for the given cluster, then restore the backup on this test
server. The job is successfull if the backup is succesfully restored on the test
server.

.nf
# \fBs9s backup \\
    --verify \\
    --log \\
    --backup-id=1 \\
    --test-server=192.168.0.55 \\
    --cluster-id=1
.fi
