.SH SYNOPSIS
.B s9s-cluster

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBs9s\fP  is a command line tool for ClusterControl, which can be used to
deploy and operate MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Main Option"
The application should always be started using a main option that sets what
operation should be performed. This "main option" should be one of the
following:

.TP
.B --create
Creates a new account on the cluster. Please note, the account is an account of
the cluster and not a user of the Cmon system.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
mys9s account \\
    --create \\
    --cluster-id=$CLUSTER_ID \\
    --account="pipas:password@myhost.com" \\
    --privileges="cmon.*:ALL"
.fi

.TP
.B --delete 
Remove the account.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
# \fBs9s account \\
    --delete \\
    --cluster-id=1 \\
    --account="joe"\fR
.fi

.TP
.B --grant
Grant privileges for an account on one or more databases.

.TP
.B -L, --list
Lists the accounts on the cluster.

.B EXAMPLE
.nf
# \fBs9s account \\
    --list \\
    --long \\
    --cluster-id=1\fR
.fi

.SS Generic Options

.TP
.B \-\^\-help
Print the help message and exist.

.TP
.B \-\^\-debug
Print even the debug level messages.

.TP
.B \-v, \-\^\-verbose
Print more messages than normally.

.TP
.B \-V, \-\^\-version
Print version information and exit.

.TP
.BR \-c " [\fIPROT\fP://]\fIHOSTNAME\fP[:\fIPORT\fP]" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-controller=" [\fIPROT\fP://]\\fIHOSTNAME\fP[:\fIPORT\fP]
The host name of the Cmon Controller. The protocol and port is also accepted as
part of the hostname (e.g. --controller="https://127.0.0.1:9556").

.TP
.BI \-u " USERNAME" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-cmon\-user=" USERNAME
Sets the name of the Cmon user (the name of the account maintained by the Cmon
Controller) to be used to authenticate. Since most of the functionality needs
authentication this command line option should be very frequently used or set in
the configuration file. Please check the documentation of the s9s.conf(5) to see
how the Cmon User can be set using the \fBcmon_user\fP configuration variable.

.TP
.BI \-p " PASSWORD" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-password=" PASSWORD
The password for the Cmon User (whose user name is set using the 
\fB\-\^\-cmon\-user\fP command line option or using the \fBcmon_user\fP
configuration value). Providing the password is not mandatory, the user
authentication can also be done using a private/public keypair automatically.

.TP
.BI \-\^\-private\-key\-file= FILE
The path to the private key file that will be used for the authentication. The
default value for the private key is \fB~/.s9s/username.key\fP.

.TP
.B \-l, \-\^\-long
This option is similar to the -l option for the standard ls UNIX utility
program. If the program creates a list of objects this option will change its
format to show more details.

.TP
.B --print-json
The JSON strings will be printed while communicating with the controller. This 
option is for debugging purposes.

.TP
.BR \-\^\-color [ =\fIWHEN\fP "]
Turn on and off the syntax highlighting of the output. The supported values for 
.I WHEN
is
.BR never ", " always ", or " auto .

.TP
.B \-\^\-batch
Print no messages. If the application created a job print only the job ID number
and exit. If the command prints data do not use syntax highlight, headers,
totals, only the pure table to be processed using filters.

.TP
.B \-\^\-no\-header
Do not print headers for tables.

.\"
.\" The options about the account. 
.\"
.SS Account Options

.TP
.BI --account= USERNAME[:PASSWORD][@HOSTNAME]
The account to be used or created on the cluster. The command line option
argument may contain a username, a password for the user and a hostname
identifying the host from where the user may log in.

The s9s command line tool will handle the command line option argument as an URL
encoded string, so if the password for example contains an '@' character, it
should be encoded as '%40'. Url encoded parts are supported anywhere in the
string, usernames and passwords (and even hostnames) may also have special 
characters.

.TP 
.B --private
Create a secure, more restricted account on the cluster. The actual
interpretation of this flag depends on the controller, the current version is
restricting the access to the ProxySql servers. The account that is created with
the \fB\-\-private\fR option will not be imported into the ProxySql
to have access through the ProxySql server immadiately after they created on 
the cluster.

.TP
.BI --privileges= EXPRESSION
Privileges to be granted to a user account on the server. The privileges are
specified using a simple language that is interpreted by the Cmon Controller. 
The language is specified as follows:

.nf
  expression: specification[;...] 
  
  specification: [object[,...]:]privilege[,...]
  
  object: {
      *
    | *.*
    | database_name.*
    | database_name.table_name
    | database_name
  }
.fi

Please note that an object name on itself is a database name (and not a table
name) and multiple objects can be enumerated by using the ',' as separator. It
is also important that multiple specifications can be enumerated using the
semicolon as separator.

The expression \fB"MyDb:INSERT,UPDATE;Other:SELECT"\fP for example defines
\fBINSERT\fP and \fBUPDATE\fP privileges on the \fBMyDb\fP database and
\fBSELECT\fP privilege on the \fBOther\fP database. The expression
\fB"INSERT,UPDATE"\fP on the other hand would specify \fBINSERT\fP and
\fBUPDATE\fP privileges on all databases and all tables.


.TP
.BI --with-database
Create a database for the new account while creating a new user account on the 
cluster. The name of the database will be the same as the name of the account
and all access rights will be granted for the account to use the database.

.\"
.\" The environment variables.
.\"
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The s9s application will read and consider a number of environment variables.
Please check s9s(1) for more information.
